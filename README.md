# The 'Right-First-Time' Intake Pattern
**Junior Business Analyst Portfolio | Public Sector Digital Optimisation**

## The Problem
In high-volume public sector intake (DWP benefits, NHS referrals, Local Government permits), 
30% of submissions fail initial validation due to missing or conflicting data. This creates 
"swivel chair" rework for caseworkers and delays for citizens.

## The Solution
A **Smart Intake** workflow that validates evidence *before* it reaches the decision-maker, 
while maintaining public sector standards (accessibility, audit, GDPR).

## What This Demonstrates
- **Process Analysis**: AS-IS/TO-BE mapping of manual vs. automated triage
- **Requirements Engineering**: Gherkin BDD for complex validation rules  
- **Data Specifications**: JSON schemas for developer handoff
- **Governance Awareness**: Risk assessment for sensitive data handling (GDPR, WCAG 2.1)

## Domain Context (Examples Only)
This pattern is domain-agnostic. Specific applications would include:
- **DWP**: UC claim evidence validation (bank statement format checks)
- **NHS**: Referral completeness (mandatory clinical attachments)
- **Local Gov**: Planning permission pre-checks (mandatory documents)

*Domain-specific policy rules would be elaborated with Subject Matter Experts during discovery.*

## Current Status
**Early-career BA** with foundational DWP ecosystem knowledge. 

**Seeking**: Junior BA role at Sopra Steria (NHS Integrated Care or DWP Digital) with 
mentorship from Senior BAs to develop domain expertise in health informatics.

**Learning Plan**: NHS Continuing Healthcare framework (Q1 2026), FHIR standards (Q2 2026).
